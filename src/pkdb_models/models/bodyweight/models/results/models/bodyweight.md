# model: bodyweight
Autogenerated ODE System from SBML with [sbmlutils](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/sbmlutils).
```
time: [min]
substance: [mmol]
extent: [mmol]
volume: [l]
area: [m^2]
length: [m]
```

## Parameters `p`
```
BW0 = 75.0  # [kg] bodyweight  
D = 0.0  # [mmol/l] GLP-1 agonist concentration in plasma  
EC50_FAT = 2.5e-05  # [mmol/l] EC50 for GLP-1 agonist on fat loss  
Emax_FAT = 1e-05  # [1/min] Emax for GLP-1 agonist on fat loss (rate of fat change)  
HEIGHT = 170.0  # [cm] height [cm]  
SEX = 0.0  # [-] sex  
conversion_cm_per_m = 100.0  # [cm/m] Conversion factor cm to m  
gamma_FAT = 1.0  # [-] gamma for GLP-1 agonist on fat loss  
```

## Initial conditions `x0`
```
DFAT = 0.0  # [kg] change in additional fat to LBM [kg]  
```

## ODE system
```
# y
LBW0 = 0.407 * BW0 + 0.267 * HEIGHT - 19.2  # [kg]   
FAT0 = BW0 - LBW0  # [kg]   
FAT = FAT0 + DFAT  # [kg] additional fat to LBM [kg]  
BW = LBW0 + FAT  # [kg] bodyweight  
BMI = BW / ((HEIGHT / conversion_cm_per_m) * HEIGHT / conversion_cm_per_m)  # [kg/m^2]   
BSA = 0.024265 * (BW / 1)**0.5378 * (HEIGHT / 1)**0.3964  # [m^2]   
BW_change = BW - BW0  # [kg] bodyweight change  
BW_ratio = BW / BW0  # [-] bodyweight ratio  
BW_relchange = (BW - BW0) / BW0  # [-] bodyweight relative change  

# odes
d DFAT/dt = -FAT * Emax_FAT * D**gamma_FAT / (D**gamma_FAT + EC50_FAT**gamma_FAT)  # [kg/min] change in additional fat to LBM [kg]
