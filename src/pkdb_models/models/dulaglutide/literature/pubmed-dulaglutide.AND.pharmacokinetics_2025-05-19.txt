TI  - Brain uptake pharmacokinetics of albiglutide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, and 
      DA5-CH in the search for new treatments of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of peptide incretin receptor agonists (IRAs) show promise as 
      therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Transport 
      across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one way for IRAs to act directly within 
      the brain. To determine which IRAs are high priority candidates for treating 
      these disorders, we have studied their brain uptake pharmacokinetics. METHODS: We 
      quantitatively measure the ability of four IRAs to cross the BBB. We injected 
      adult male CD-1 mice intravenously with (125)I- or (14)C-labeled albiglutide, 
      dulaglutide, DA5-CH, or tirzepatide and used multiple-time regression analyses to 
      measure brain kinetics up to 1 hour. For those IRAs failing to enter the brain 
      1 h after intravenous injection, we also investigated their ability to enter over 
      a longer time frame (i.e., 6 h). RESULTS: Albiglutide and dulaglutide had the 
      fastest brain uptake rates within 1 hour. DA5-CH appears to enter the brain 
      rapidly, reaching equilibrium quickly. Tirzepatide does not appear to cross the 
      BBB within 1 h after iv injection but like albumin, did so slowly over 6 h, 
      presumably via the extracellular pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We find that IRAs can 
      cross the BBB by two separate processes; one that is fast and one that is slow. 
      Three of the four IRAs investigated here have fast rates of transport and should 
      be taken into consideration for testing as AD and PD therapeutics as they would 
      have the ability to act quickly and directly on the brain as a whole.

      (SUSTAIN 7): a randomised, open-label, phase 3b trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite common mechanisms of actions, glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonists differ in structure, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical 
      effects. This head-to-head trial compared semaglutide with dulaglutide in 
      patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was an 
      open-label, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 194 hospitals, clinical 
      institutions or private practices in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 
      years or older and had type 2 diabetes with HbA(1c) 7·0-10·5% (53·0-91·0 
      mmol/mol) on metformin monotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by 
      use of an interactive web-response system to once a week treatment with either 
      semaglutide 0·5 mg, dulaglutide 0·75 mg, semaglutide 1·0 mg, or dulaglutide 1·5 
      mg subcutaneously. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percentage 
      HbA(1c); the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in bodyweight, both at 
      week 40. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients 
      exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment and 
      before the onset of rescue medication. The safety population included all 
      randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained 
      while on treatment. The trial was powered for HbA(1c) non-inferiority (margin 
      0·4%) and bodyweight superiority. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02648204. FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, 2016, and June 
      22, 2016, 1201 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; of these, 301 were 
      exposed to semaglutide 0·5 mg, 299 to dulaglutide 0·75 mg, 300 to semaglutide 1·0 
      mg, and 299 to dulaglutide 1·5 mg. 72 (6%) patients withdrew from the trial (22 
      receiving semaglutide 0·5 mg, 13 receiving dulaglutide 0·75 mg, 21 receiving 
      semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 16 receiving dulaglutide 1·5 mg). From overall baseline 
      mean, mean percentage HbA(1c) was reduced by 1·5 (SE 0·06) percentage points with 
      semaglutide 0·5 mg versus 1·1 (0·05) percentage points with dulaglutide 0·75 mg 
      (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·40 percentage points [95% CI -0·55 to 
      -0·25]; p<0·0001) and by 1·8 (0·06) percentage points with semaglutide 1·0 mg 
      versus 1·4 (0·06) percentage points with dulaglutide 1·5 mg (ETD -0·41 percentage 
      points [-0·57 to -0·25]; p<0·0001). From overall baseline mean, mean bodyweight 
      was reduced by 4·6 kg (SE 0·28) with semaglutide 0·5 mg compared with 2·3 kg 
      (0·27) with dulaglutide 0·75 mg (ETD -2·26 kg [-3·02 to -1·51]; p<0·0001) and by 
      6·5 kg (0·28) with semaglutide 1·0 mg compared with 3·0 kg (0·27) with 
      dulaglutide 1·5 mg (ETD -3·55 kg [-4·32 to -2·78]; p<0·0001). Gastrointestinal 
      disorders were the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 129 (43%) 
      of 301 patients receiving semaglutide 0·5 mg, 133 (44%) of 300 patients receiving 
      semaglutide 1·0 mg, 100 (33%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 0·75 mg, and 
      in 143 (48%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 1·5 mg. Gastrointestinal 
      disorders were also the most common reason for discontinuing treatment with 
      semaglutide and dulaglutide. There were six fatalities: one in each semaglutide 
      group and two in each dulaglutide group. INTERPRETATION: At low and high doses, 
      semaglutide was superior to dulaglutide in improving glycaemic control and 
      reducing bodyweight, enabling a significantly greater number of patients with 
      type 2 diabetes to achieve clinically meaningful glycaemic targets and weight 
      loss, with a similar safety profile. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk.

AB  - In healthy humans, the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted after 
      eating and lowers glucose concentrations by augmenting insulin secretion and 
      suppressing glucagon release. Additional effects of GLP-1 include retardation of 
      gastric emptying, suppression of appetite and, potentially, inhibition of β-cell 
      apoptosis. Native GLP-1 is degraded within ~2-3 min in the circulation; various 
      GLP-1 receptor agonists have, therefore, been developed to provide prolonged in 
      vivo actions. These GLP-1 receptor agonists can be categorized as either 
      short-acting compounds, which provide short-lived receptor activation (such as 
      exenatide and lixisenatide) or as long-acting compounds (for example albiglutide, 
      dulaglutide, exenatide long-acting release, and liraglutide), which activate the 
      GLP-1 receptor continuously at their recommended dose. The pharmacokinetic 
      differences between these drugs lead to important differences in their 
      pharmacodynamic profiles. The short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists primarily 
      lower postprandial blood glucose levels through inhibition of gastric emptying, 
      whereas the long-acting compounds have a stronger effect on fasting glucose 
      levels, which is mediated predominantly through their insulinotropic and 
      glucagonostatic actions. The adverse effect profiles of these compounds also 
      differ. The individual properties of the various GLP-1 receptor agonists might 
      enable incretin-based treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to be tailored to the 
      needs of each patient.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and 
      safety of a single dulaglutide dose in Chinese healthy subjects and of multiple 
      dulaglutide doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: This two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 16 
      healthy subjects randomized to receive a single dose of placebo and two of three 
      dulaglutide doses (0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1.5 mg) in three treatment periods, and 42 
      patients with T2DM randomized to receive placebo or one of the three dulaglutide 
      doses once weekly for 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetics and safety parameters were 
      assessed in all participants, and pharmacodynamics effects were investigated in 
      patients with T2DM. RESULTS: Following a single-dose administration of 0.5 mg, 
      0.75 mg, or 1.5 mg dulaglutide in healthy subjects, geometric mean maximum 
      concentrations (C(max)) were 29.4, 44.2, and 81.5 ng/mL, respectively. Following 
      weekly administration in patients with T2DM for 4 weeks, C(max) were 26.3, 41.4, 
      and 70.2 ng/mL, respectively, with accumulation ratios of 1.33-1.39. Geometric 
      mean for half-life of 4-5 days and median time to C(max) (t(max)) of 
      approximately 48 h were observed in both study populations. Dose-proportional 
      increases in drug exposure were observed after both single and multiple dosing. 
      Significant reductions in baseline-corrected fasting glucose and hemoglobin 
      A1c (HbA1c) were observed in patients with T2DM who received dulaglutide 0.75 mg 
      and 1.5 mg. Dulaglutide was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events 
      being gastrointestinal disorders of mild severity. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles of dulaglutide demonstrated in the present 
      study support a once-weekly dosing regimen in Chinese patients with T2DM. TRIAL

TI  - Oral Semaglutide: A Review of the First Oral Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor 
      Agonist.
PG  - 10-18
LID - 10.1089/dia.2019.0185 [doi]
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are highly effective at 
      lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and facilitating weight loss. Four agents in the 
      GLP-1 RA class, albiglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, also have 
      cardioprotective effects. However, subcutaneous administration of these agents 
      remains a major reason for their underutilization. A new coformulation of 
      semaglutide with sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino caprylate (SNAC) is the 
      first oral GLP-1 RA reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The 
      SNAC technology prevents destruction of semaglutide in the stomach and 
      facilitates transcellular absorption through the gastric membrane enabling 
      semaglutide to reach systemic circulation intact. The oral formulation of 
      semaglutide was studied in the PIONEER trials, demonstrating similar efficacy to 
      the presently available GLP-1 RAs with regard to HbA1c lowering and weight loss. 
      Although the PIONEER 6 trial suggests positive effects on cardiovascular 
      mortality with oral semaglutide, these benefits may not fully be appreciated 
      until the completion of the SOUL trial.

      with type 2 diabetes: a phase 1b, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      randomised, multiple-ascending dose trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating hyperglycaemia and obesity in individuals with type 2 
      diabetes using multi-receptor agonists can improve short-term and long-term 
      outcomes. LY3437943 is a single peptide with agonist activity for glucagon, 
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide 1 
      (GLP-1) receptors that is currently in development for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes and for the treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities. We 
      investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple 
      weekly doses of LY3437943 in people with type 2 diabetes in a 12-week study. 
      METHODS: In this phase 1b, proof-of-concept, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      randomised, multiple-ascending dose trial, adults (aged 20-70 years) with type 2 
      diabetes for at least 3 months, a glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) value of 
      7·0-10·5%, body-mass index of 23-50 kg/m(2), and stable bodyweight (<5% change in 
      previous 3 months) were recruited at four centres in the USA. Using an 
      interactive web-response system, participants were randomly assigned to receive 
      once-weekly subcutaneous injections of LY3437943, placebo, or dulaglutide 1·5 mg 
      over a 12-week period. Five ascending dose cohorts were studied, with 
      randomisation in each cohort such that a minimum of nine participants received 
      LY3437943, three received placebo, and one received dulaglutide 1·5 mg within 
      each cohort. The top doses in the two highest dose cohorts were attained via 
      stepwise dose escalations. The primary outcome was to investigate the safety and 
      tolerability of LY3437943, and characterising the pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics were secondary outcomes. Safety was analysed in all participants 
      who received at least one dose of study drug, and pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug 
      and had evaluable data. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT04143802. FINDINGS: Between Dec 18, 2019, and Dec 28, 2020, 210 people were 
      screened, of whom 72 were enrolled, received at least one dose of study drug, and 
      were included in safety analyses. 15 participants had placebo, five had 
      dulaglutide 1·5 mg and, for LY3437943, nine had 0·5 mg, nine had 1·5 mg, 11 had 3 
      mg, 11 had 3/6 mg, and 12 had 3/6/9/12 mg. 29 participants discontinued the study 
      prematurely. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 33 (63%), three 
      (60%), and eight (54%) participants who received LY3437943, dulaglutide 1·5 mg, 
      and placebo, respectively, with gastrointestinal disorders being the most 
      frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events. The pharmacokinetics of 
      LY3437943 were dose proportional and its half-life was approximately 6 days. At 
      week 12, placebo-adjusted mean daily plasma glucose significantly decreased from 
      baseline at the three highest dose LY3437943 groups (least-squares mean 
      difference -2·8 mmol/L [90% CI -4·63 to -0·94] for 3 mg; -3·1 mmol/L [-4·91 to 
      -1·22] for 3/6 mg; and -2·9 mmol/L [-4·70 to -1·01] for 3/6/9/12 mg). 
      Placebo-adjusted sHbA(1c) also decreased significantly in the three highest dose 
      groups (-1·4% [90% CI -2·17 to -0·56] for 3 mg; -1·6% [-2·37 to -0·75] for 3/6 
      mg; and -1·2% [-2·05 to -0·45] for 3/6/9/12 mg). Placebo-adjusted bodyweight 
      reduction with LY3437943 appeared to be dose dependent (up to -8·96 kg [90% CI 
      -11·16 to -6·75] in the 3/6/9/12 mg group). INTERPRETATION: In this early phase 
      study, LY3437943 showed an acceptable safety profile, and its pharmacokinetics 
      suggest suitability for once-weekly dosing. This finding, together with the 
      pharmacodynamic findings of robust reductions in glucose and bodyweight, provides 
      support for phase 2 development. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.

TI  - Anti-obesity effects of GIPR antagonists alone and in combination with GLP-1R 
      agonists in preclinical models.

AB  - Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) has been 
      identified in multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as a contributor to 
      obesity, and GIPR knockout mice are protected against diet-induced obesity (DIO). 
      On the basis of this genetic evidence, we developed anti-GIPR antagonistic 
      antibodies as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and 
      observed that a mouse anti-murine GIPR antibody (muGIPR-Ab) protected against 
      body weight gain, improved multiple metabolic parameters, and was associated with 
      reduced food intake and resting respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in DIO mice. We 
      replicated these results in obese nonhuman primates (NHPs) using an anti-human 
      GIPR antibody (hGIPR-Ab) and found that weight loss was more pronounced than in 
      mice. In addition, we observed enhanced weight loss in DIO mice and NHPs when 
      anti-GIPR antibodies were codosed with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) 
      agonists. Mechanistic and crystallographic studies demonstrated that hGIPR-Ab 
      displaced GIP and bound to GIPR using the same conserved hydrophobic residues as 
      GIP. Further, using a conditional knockout mouse model, we excluded the role of 
      GIPR in pancreatic β-cells in the regulation of body weight and response to GIPR 
      antagonism. In conclusion, these data provide preclinical validation of a 
      therapeutic approach to treat obesity with anti-GIPR antibodies.

TI  - Is retatrutide (LY3437943), a GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor agonist a step 
      forward in the treatment of diabetes and obesity?
PG  - 355-359
LID - 10.1080/13543784.2023.2206560 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite there being a wide range of medicines available for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, the high rate of mortality suggests treatment needs 
      to be improved. Only a few medicines have shown long-term effectiveness in 
      obesity, and new medicines are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: A 
      multiple-ascending dose phase 1b clinical trial of a new drug retatrutide 
      (LY3437943), which in addition to stimulating Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and 
      Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, stimulates glucagon 
      receptors, in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Retatrutide was relatively safe and 
      pharmacokinetics support once-weekly dosing. EXPERT OPINION: The role of 
      stimulating glucagon receptors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity 
      is poorly defined and needs to be clarified. Although retatrutide may be superior 
      to the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide in reducing plasma glucose and body 
      weight, this is not a meaningful comparison, as another GLP-1 receptor agonist 
      (semaglutide) is more potent than dulaglutide at this and may have similar 
      efficacy to retatrutide. Retatrutide also needs to be compared to another Eli 
      Lilly and Company drug, the combined GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, tirzepatide. 
      The safety of retatrutide needs to be determined in larger and longer trials.

TI  - Dulaglutide: A Review in Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 407-18
LID - 10.1007/s40259-015-0143-4 [doi]
AB  - Dulaglutide (Trulicity™) is a once-weekly subcutaneously administered 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist produced by recombinant DNA 
      technology and approved in numerous countries as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
      for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In randomized controlled 
      trials in patients with T2DM, dulaglutide monotherapy was noninferior to 
      once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide monotherapy and significantly more effective 
      than oral metformin monotherapy in improving glycemic control at 26 weeks. When 
      used in combination with other agents (including metformin, metformin and a 
      sulfonylurea, metformin and oral pioglitazone, and prandial insulin ± metformin), 
      dulaglutide was noninferior to once-daily liraglutide and significantly more 
      effective than once-daily oral sitagliptin, twice-daily subcutaneous exenatide, 
      and once-daily subcutaneous insulin glargine in terms of improvements in glycated 
      hemoglobin from baseline at 26 or 52 weeks, in trials of 26-104 weeks' duration. 
      Moreover, dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly, but not 0.75 mg once weekly, was 
      associated with consistent reductions form baseline in bodyweight. Improvements 
      in glycemic control and bodyweight were maintained during long-term treatment (up 
      to 2 years). Dulaglutide was generally well tolerated, with a low inherent risk 
      of hypoglycemia. The most frequently reported adverse events in clinical trials 
      were gastrointestinal-related (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). Thus, 
      dulaglutide is a useful option for the treatment of adult patients with T2DM.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Dulaglutide Biosimilar LY05008 Versus the Reference 
      Product Dulaglutide (Trulicity) in Chinese Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: 
      A Randomized, Open-Label, Active Comparator Study.
PG  - e70077
LID - 10.1111/1753-0407.70077 [doi]
LID - e70077
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has 
      been approved for improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of 
      cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. A previous result in healthy Chinese male 
      subjects demonstrated the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of LY05008 and the 
      licensed product dulaglutide, with comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles. 
      A well-controlled phase 3 study with an adequate sample size was subsequently 
      conducted for safety and efficacy evaluation. METHODS: In a multicenter, 
      randomized, open-label, active comparator phase 3 study, Chinese adults diagnosed 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a 
      subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg LY05008 or dulaglutide once weekly for 24 weeks. 
      The primary endpoint was the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24. The 
      secondary endpoints included the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12; 
      the proportion of patients who had achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at Weeks 12 and 24; and 
      the mean change in body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, and 2-h 
      postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) level from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24. Safety, 
      PK, and immunogenicity profiles were also included for data analysis. RESULTS: A 
      total of 440 patients were randomized to receive LY05008 (n = 222) or dulaglutide 
      (n = 218). The mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 in the LY05008 
      group and dulaglutide group were -1.44% and -1.41%, respectively, with a least 
      square mean difference (LSMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.06% (-0.08, 
      0.19) (p > 0.05). Efficacy equivalence could be demonstrated since the 95% CI 
      between the reference drug and a biosimilar fell entirely within the range of 
      (-0.4%, 0.4%). The mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to Week 12 in the LY05008 
      group and dulaglutide group were -1.47% and -1.39% (p > 0.05), respectively. At 
      Week 12, 40.1% of patients who received LY05008 and 42.2% of those who received 
      dulaglutide had a decrease in the HbA1c level to 6.5% or less, and 60.4% and 
      60.6% of patients in the LY05008 group and the dulaglutide group had a decrease 
      in the HbA1C level < 7%, respectively. At Week 24, 41.0% and 43.6% of patients 
      achieved an HbA1c ≤ 6.5%. 55.9% and 66.5% of patients in the LY05008 group and 
      the dulaglutide group achieved the HbA1c goal of < 7%, respectively. The mean 
      changes in body weight from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24 in the LY05008 group and 
      dulaglutide group were -2.01 and -1.71 kg (p > 0.05) and -2.68 and -2.42 kg 
      (p > 0.05), respectively. The mean changes in FPG level from baseline to Weeks 12 
      and 24 in the LY05008 group and dulaglutide group were -2.578 and -2.681 mmol/L 
      (p > 0.05) and -2.222 and -2.690 mmol/L, respectively. In the LY05008 group and 
      the dulaglutide group, the mean changes in 2-h PPG levels from baseline to Weeks 
      12 and 24 were -4.364 and -4.800 mmol/L(p > 0.05) and-3.502 and -4.217 mmol/L 
      (p > 0.05), respectively. The common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 
      the LY05008 and dulaglutide groups were decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper 
      respiratory tract infection, hyperuricemia, nausea, urinary tract infection, and 
      vomiting. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. No significant 
      differences were observed between the groups in terms of TEAEs. Hypoglycemic 
      events were noted in 0.9% of patients who had received LY05008 and in 3.7% of 
      those who had received dulaglutide. Serious adverse events were reported in 4.1% 
      of patients in the LY05008 group and in 3.7% of patients in the dulaglutide 
      group. The PK parameter C(trough) and immunogenicity profiles were similar across 
      the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The primary endpoint was met in this study 
      through the demonstration of equivalent efficacy in HbA1c reduction in Chinese 
      adults with T2DM between LY05008 and dulaglutide. Overall, the biosimilar product 
      LY05008 showed comparable safety, PK, and immunogenicity profiles against the 
      reference drug dulaglutide. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S506957 [doi]
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are peptide-derived analogs 
      that were initially investigated to treat type 2 diabetes. Recently, a drug 
      targeting the receptors of both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
      polypeptide (GIP) (tirzepatide) has been introduced to the market, and its 
      indications have expanded to include treating obesity. Here, we review the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and 
      pharmacokinetic modeling approaches of four currently available GLP-1 RAs 
      (exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide) and tirzepatide. To 
      address the extremely short half-life (2 min) of native human GLP-1, structural 
      modifications have been applied to GLP-1 RAs and a dual GLP-1/GIP RA. These 
      include amino acid sequence substitutions, fatty acid conjugation using a linker, 
      and fusion with albumin or the IgG fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, resulting 
      in minimal metabolism and renal excretion. Due to their diverse structures, the 
      pharmacokinetic profiles vary, and a prolonged half-life may be associated with 
      an increased risk of adverse events. Clinically significant drug-metabolizing 
      enzyme- and transporter-mediated DDIs are yet to be reported. 
      Mechanism-of-action-mediated DDIs are currently limited to those involving 
      delayed gastric emptying, and most studies have found them to be clinically 
      insignificant. However, significant changes in exposure were observed for oral 
      contraceptives and levothyroxine following the administration of tirzepatide and 
      oral semaglutide, respectively, indicating the need for close monitoring in these 
      instances. Thirty models have been developed to predict pharmacokinetics and 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling can be useful for assessing 
      mechanism-of-action-mediated DDIs. Alterations in the volume of distribution and 
      clearance resulting from other mechanisms of action (eg, reduced fat mass, 
      changes in cytochrome P450 activity, and glomerular filtration rate) are key 
      factors in determining pharmacokinetics. However, the DDIs mediated by these 
      factors remain poorly understood and require further investigation to ensure that 
      GLP-1 RAs can be safely used with concomitant medications.

      diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
      the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), dulaglutide, in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was 
      completed to identify publications from 1947 to October 2014 using the search 
      terms dulaglutide and LY2189265. References were reviewed to identify additional 
      resources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were included if they 
      evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of dulaglutide. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Dulaglutide reduces both glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and weight 
      by stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon in a glucose-dependent 
      manner, delaying gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Dulaglutide consists of 
      2 GLP-1 analogues that have been modified to make it a long-acting, once-weekly 
      agent. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with 
      metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, and insulin lispro. It has demonstrated 
      superior A1C reduction compared with placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, 
      sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It demonstrated noninferiority in A1C 
      reduction to liraglutide. Dulaglutide changed A1C by -0.78% to -1.51%, and it 
      changed weight by -0.35 kg to -3.03 kg. The most common adverse effects in 
      clinical studies were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Dulaglutide is 
      the fifth GLP-1 RA approved for T2D in the United States. It is an attractive 
      option because it is dosed once-weekly, provides A1C lowering similar to 
      liraglutide, weight reduction similar to exenatide, and has an adverse effect 
      profile similar to exenatide and liraglutide.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Dulaglutide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: 
      Analyses of Data from Clinical Trials.
PG  - 625-34
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0338-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonist administered as once-weekly subcutaneous injections for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The clinical pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide 
      were characterized in patients with T2D and healthy subjects. METHODS: The 
      pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were assessed throughout clinical development, 
      including conventional pharmacokinetic analysis in clinical pharmacology studies 
      and population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from combined phase 2 and phase 3 
      studies in patients with T2D. The effects of potential covariates on dulaglutide 
      population pharmacokinetics were evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects models. 
      RESULTS: Dulaglutide gradually reached the maximum concentration in 48 h and had 
      a terminal elimination half-life of 5 days. Steady state was achieved between the 
      second and fourth doses. The accumulation ratio was 1.56 for the 1.5 mg dose. 
      Intra-individual variability estimates for the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve and the maximum concentration were both <17% 
      [coefficient of variation (CV)]. There was no difference in pharmacokinetics 
      between injection sites (arm, thigh or abdomen). Dulaglutide pharmacokinetics 
      were well described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
      elimination. The population clearance was estimated at 0.126 L/h 
      [inter-individual variability (CV) 33.8%]. Age, body weight, sex, race and 
      ethnicity did not influence dulaglutide pharmacokinetics to any clinically 
      relevant degree. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide support 
      once-weekly administration in patients with T2D. The pharmacokinetic findings 
      suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary on the basis of body weight, sex, 
      age, race or ethnicity or site of injection.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are injectable agents used 
      for the treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. The interest for this 
      pharmacological class is rising with the development of once weekly compounds and 
      the demonstration of a potential reduction in cardiorenal outcomes. Areas 
      covered: The paper describes the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      characteristics of dulaglutide, a new once-weekly GLP-1 RA. Dulaglutide was 
      extensively investigated in the phase-3 AWARD program, which demonstrated its 
      safety and efficacy when compared to placebo or active glucose-lowering agents in 
      patients treated with diet alone, metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy, oral 
      dual therapies and basal insulin. In both Caucasian and Japanese patients, 
      comparative trials showed better glucose control with dulaglutide, with a minimal 
      risk of hypoglycemia and weight loss, but at the expense of an increased dropout 
      rate due to side effects, mostly transient gastrointestinal disturbances. 
      Dulaglutide proved its non-inferiority versus liraglutide and the safety and 
      tolerance profile is similar to that of other GLP-1 RAs. Expert opinion: The 
      once-weekly formulation and the combined positive effects on both glucose control 
      and weight improves patient satisfaction despite nausea. Dulaglutide must prove 
      its capacity to reduce cardiovascular and diabetic complications in the ongoing 
      prospective REWIND trial.

TI  - A model-based simulation of glycaemic control and body weight when switching from 
      semaglutide to 3.0- and 4.5-mg doses of once-weekly dulaglutide.
PG  - 302-311
LID - 10.1111/dom.14582 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate HbA1c and body weight changes when semaglutide 0.5- or 1.0-mg 
      once-weekly (QW) is switched to dulaglutide 3.0- or 4.5-mg QW via 
      exposure-response modelling. METHODS: HbA1c and body weight time-course models 
      were developed and validated with data from the SUSTAIN 1 to 10 trials for 
      semaglutide and the AWARD-11 trial for dulaglutide. Simulations were conducted 
      for HbA1c and body weight over 52 weeks. In the initial 26 weeks, semaglutide was 
      initiated at 0.25-mg and titrated to 0.5- or 1.0-mg QW via 4-weekly stepwise 
      titration, followed by 26 weeks of dulaglutide initiated at 0.75- or 1.5-mg QW 
      and escalated to 3.0- or 4.5-mg QW via 4-weekly stepwise titration. RESULTS: At 
      26 weeks, model-predicted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and weight for 
      semaglutide 0.5 mg were up to -1.55% and -3.44 kg, respectively. After switching 
      to dulaglutide 3.0 mg, further reductions were 0.19% and 1.40 kg, respectively, 
      at 52 weeks. Predicted mean HbA1c and weight changes for semaglutide 1.0 mg at 
      26 weeks were -1.84% and -4.96 kg, respectively; after switching to dulaglutide 
      4.5 mg, HbA1c was maintained with additional weight reduction of up to 0.57 kg at 
      52 weeks. Glycaemic control was preserved when switching from semaglutide 1.0 mg 
      to dulaglutide 3.0 mg. CONCLUSION: Switching from semaglutide 0.5 mg to 
      dulaglutide 3.0 or 4.5 mg with dose escalation potentially yields additional 
      HbA1c and weight reductions; switching from semaglutide 1.0 mg to dulaglutide 
      4.5 mg may enhance weight loss.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to provide a review of current data of the most 
      recently approved glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-receptor agonist, dulaglutide, in 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To complete this, a PubMed search was performed 
      to identify manuscripts published from 1947 to July 2015. The search terms 
      "Trulicity", "dulaglutide", and "LY2189265" were utilized, and publications were 
      included if they evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, 
      or patient-reported outcomes of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor 
      agonist that mimics endogenous GLP-1, the hormone produced in response to food 
      intake. Modifications have been made to the molecule to delay breakdown and allow 
      for once-weekly dosing. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in 
      combination with several agents, including metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, 
      and insulin lispro. Dulaglutide has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to 
      placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It 
      was found to be noninferior to liraglutide. The most common adverse effects in 
      clinical studies were gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and patient 
      satisfaction was high with the use of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is an appealing 
      option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on its once-weekly dosing, A1c 
      lowering comparable to liraglutide, weight reduction comparable to exenatide, and 
      a similar adverse-effect profile to other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs), safety, and 
      immunogenicity of the biosimilar HEC14028 compared to reference Trulicity® 
      (dulaglutide) in healthy male Chinese subjects. This study was a single-center, 
      randomized, open, single-dose, parallel-controlled comparative Phase I clinical 
      trial, including a screening period of up to 14 days, a 17-day observation period 
      after administration, and a 7-day safety follow-up period. A total of 68 healthy 
      male subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to the test group (HEC14028) and the 
      reference group (dulaglutide) (single 0.75 mg abdominal subcutaneous dose). The 
      primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of HEC14028 
      and compare the pharmacokinetic similarities between HEC14028 and dulaglutide. 
      The primary PK endpoints were maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area 
      under the blood concentration-time curve from zero time to the estimated infinite 
      time (AUC(0-∞)). The study results showed that HEC14028 and dulaglutide were 
      pharmacokinetically equivalent: 90% confidence interval (CI) of C(max) and 
      AUC(0-∞) geometric mean ratios were 102.9%-122.0% and 97.1%-116.9%, respectively, 
      which were both within the range of 80.00%-125.00%. No grade 3 or above treatment 
      emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs leading to 
      withdrawal from the trial, or TEAEs leading to death were reported in this study. 
      Both HEC14028 and dulaglutide showed good and similar safety profiles, and no 
      incremental immunogenicity was observed in subjects receiving HEC14028 and 
      dulaglutide.

TI  - Practical Applications of a Nausea and Vomiting Model in the Clinical Development 
      of Additional Doses of Dulaglutide.
PG  - 215-226
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2373 [doi]
AB  - Dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg weekly doses were approved for additional glycemic 
      control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with 
      metformin and 0.75 or 1.5 mg weekly doses of dulaglutide. Effects such as nausea 
      and vomiting are commonly reported with dulaglutide and other glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonist therapies. Based on a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      model-informed approach, a stepwise dose-escalation scheme with 4-week intervals 
      between dose increments was suggested to mitigate gastrointestinal events for 
      dulaglutide. These gastrointestinal events are dose dependent and attenuate over 
      time with repeated dosing. A Markov chain Monte Carlo 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic joint model was developed using AWARD-11 data (N 
      = 1842) to optimize dulaglutide dose escalation to 3.0 and 4.5 mg to mitigate 
      gastrointestinal events. Model simulations evaluated probabilities of nausea and 
      vomiting events for various dosing scenarios in patients needing higher doses for 
      additional glycemic control. The model indicated that patients may dose escalate 
      from 1.5 to 3.0 mg, then 4.5 mg weekly after at least 4 weeks on each dose. No 
      clinically meaningful differences in nausea or vomiting events were expected when 
      patients escalated to 3.0 or 4.5 mg following initiation at 0.75 or 1.5 mg 
      dulaglutide. Based on the findings of this model, a minimum 4-week duration at 
      each dose before escalation was appropriate to reduce gastrointestinal events of 
      dulaglutide, consistent with observed gastrointestinal events data from the 
      AWARD-11 study and supporting the currently recommended dose-escalation regimen 
      of dulaglutide doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg for additional glycemic control.

TI  - Comparing regional brain uptake of incretin receptor agonists after intranasal 
      delivery in CD-1 mice and the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 173
LID - 10.1186/s13195-024-01537-1 [doi]
LID - 173
AB  - Targeting brain insulin resistance (BIR) has become an attractive alternative to 
      traditional therapeutic treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Incretin 
      receptor agonists (IRAs), targeting either or both of the glucagon-like peptide 1 
      (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, have 
      proven to reverse BIR and improve cognition in mouse models of AD. We previously 
      showed that many, but not all, IRAs can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after 
      intravenous (IV) delivery. Here we determined if widespread brain uptake of IRAs 
      could be achieved by circumventing the BBB using intranasal (IN) delivery, which 
      has the added advantage of minimizing adverse gastrointestinal effects of 
      systemically delivered IRAs. Of the 5 radiolabeled IRAs tested (exenatide, 
      dulaglutide, semaglutide, DA4-JC, and DA5-CH) in CD-1 mice, exenatide, 
      dulaglutide, and DA4-JC were successfully distributed throughout the brain 
      following IN delivery. We observed significant sex differences in uptake for 
      DA4-JC. Dulaglutide and DA4-JC exhibited high uptake by the hippocampus and 
      multiple neocortical areas. We further tested and found the presence of 
      AD-associated Aβ pathology minimally affected uptake of dulaglutide and DA4-JC. 
      Of the 5 tested IRAs, dulaglutide and DA4-JC are best capable of accessing brain 
      regions most vulnerable in AD (neocortex and hippocampus) after IN 
      administration. Future studies will need to be performed to determine if IN IRA 
      delivery can reduce BIR in AD or animal models of that disorder.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor analogs (GLP-1RAs) are incretin mimetics with 
      potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic action that translates to glycemic 
      control in people with type- -2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These agents 
      potentially have the ability to stimulate proliferation or prevent apoptosis of 
      pancreatic β-cells, induce weight-loss and provide vascular benefits in patients 
      with T2DM. Newer GLP-1RA, semaglutide has shown a robust reduction in HbA1c up to 
      1.5 - 1.8%. However, individual differences exist between the different GLP-1RAs, 
      in terms of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and vascular protection. 
      The potential of vascular protection offered by newer anti-diabetic agents has 
      generated a lot of excitement in the field of diabetes, and to a large extent, is 
      now driving treatment decisions. So far, six cardiovascular outcome trials of 
      GLP-1 RAs have been published, analyzing lixisenatide (ELIXA), liraglutide 
      (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6), long-acting exenatide (EXSCEL), dulaglutide 
      (REWIND), and oral semaglutide (PIONEER 6) with a follow-up duration of 2-4 
      years. LEADER, REWIND and SUSTAIN-6 trials have demonstrated a reduction in rates 
      of major adverse cardiovascular events with active GLP-1 RA treatment, but ELIXA, 
      PIONEER 6 and EXSCEL, have been neutral. In this review, we discuss the available 
      evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) analyzing the cardiovascular 
      effects of various GLP-1 RAs with the aim of comparing individual drugs. We have 
      also summarized the general aspects of GLP-1RAs that can be applied in clinical 
      practice.

TI  - Differential effects of once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist 
      dulaglutide and metformin on pancreatic β-cell and insulin sensitivity during a 
      standardized test meal in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 834-9

AB  - This substudy of the AWARD-3 trial evaluated the effects of the once-weekly 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide, versus metformin on 
      glucose control, pancreatic function and insulin sensitivity, after standardized 
      test meals in patients with type 2 diabetes. Meals were administered at baseline, 
      26 and 52 weeks to patients randomized to monotherapy with dulaglutide 1.5 
      mg/week (n = 133), dulaglutide 0.75 mg/week (n = 136), or metformin ≥1500 mg/day 
      (n = 140). Fasting and postprandial serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide and 
      glucagon levels were measured up to 3 h post-meal. β-cell function and insulin 
      sensitivity were assessed using empirical variables and mathematical modelling. 
      At 26 weeks, similar decreases in area under the curve for glucose [AUCglucose 
      (0-3 h)] were observed among all groups. β-cell function [AUCinsulin /AUCglucose 
      (0-3 h)] increased with dulaglutide and was unchanged with metformin (p ≤ 0.005, 
      both doses). Dulaglutide improved insulin secretion rate at 9 mmol/l glucose (p ≤ 
      0.04, both doses) and β-cell glucose sensitivity (p = 0.004, dulaglutide 1.5 mg). 
      Insulin sensitivity increased more with metformin versus dulaglutide. In 
      conclusion, dulaglutide improves postprandial glycaemic control after a 
      standardized test meal by enhancing β-cell function, while metformin exerts a 
      greater effect on insulin sensitivity.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are an important asset in 
      the armamentarium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). 
      Incretin failure is a critical etiopathogenetic feature of type 2 DM, which, if 
      reversed, results in improved glycaemic control. GLP-1 RAs are injectable 
      peptides that resemble the structure and function of endogenous incretin GLP-1, 
      but as they are not deactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), their 
      half-life is prolonged compared with native GLP-1. Based on their ability to 
      activate GLP-1 receptor, GLP-1 RAs are classified as short-acting (exenatide 
      twice-daily and lixisenatide once-daily), and long-acting (liraglutide once-daily 
      and the once-weekly formulations of exenatide extended-release, dulaglutide, and 
      albiglutide). Semaglutide, another long-acting, once-weekly GLP-1 RA, was 
      recently approved by the FDA and EMA. Although all of these agents potently 
      reduce haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), there are unique features and fundamental 
      differences among them related to fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia 
      reduction, weight loss potency, cardiovascular protection efficacy, and adverse 
      events profile. It is imperative that current evidence be integrated and applied 
      in the context of an individualised patient-centred approach. This should include 
      not only glucose management but also targeting as many as possible of the 
      pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for type 2 DM development and 
      progression.

TI  - Albiglutide: a unique GLP-1 receptor agonist.
PG  - 1557-1569
AB  - Albiglutide is a long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) administered by 
      weekly injection. Area covered: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties of albiglutide and its clinical effects are discussed. The review 
      encompassed a search of PubMed and a thorough analysis of the European Union and 
      US Food and Drug Administration approval documents. Expert opinion: Albiglutide 
      has a chemical structure quite distinct from that of other marketed GLP-1 RAs. 
      The agent has less gastrointestinal side effects than other comparable GLP-1 RAs 
      and is safe in patients with renal failure. As a sole treatment for diabetes and 
      used with other hypoglycemic agents, it achieves a lowering of HbA1c of up to 1%, 
      less than several competitor GLP-1 RAs. The benefit on weight reduction is 
      minimal compared to other GLP-1 RAs. There exists concern about an imbalance of 
      pancreatitis cases in the approval program as well as injection site reactions 
      which led to discontinuance of therapy in up to 2% of participants. A large long 
      term study now underway will determine if albiglutide, with its lower level of GI 
      intolerance, has a place in the treatment of patients with increased risk of 
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - A 5-week study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LY2189265, a

PG  - 426-33

AB  - AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of LY2189265 (LY), a novel, long-acting glucagen-like peptide-1 
      analogue, administered once weekly to subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 
      This was a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, subject- and investigator-blind 
      study of LY in subjects (N = 43) with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with 
      diet and exercise alone or with a single oral antidiabetic medication. Subjects 
      taking metformin or thiazolidinediones continued on their therapy. Subjects 
      receiving sulfonylurea, acarbose, repaglinide or nateglinide were switched to 
      metformin prior to enrollment. Subjects received five once-weekly doses of 0.05, 
      0.3, 1, 3, 5 or 8 mg. Effects on glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations 
      were determined during fasting and following standard test meals. The 
      pharmacokinetics of LY and its effects on HBA1c, glucagon, body weight, gastric 
      emptying and safety parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Once-weekly administration 
      of LY significantly reduced (p < 0.01) fasting plasma glucose, 2-h post-test meal 
      postprandial glucose and area under the curve (AUC) of glucose after test meals 
      at doses ≥1 mg. These effects were seen after the first dose and were sustained 
      through the weekly dosing cycle. Most doses produced statistically significant 
      increases in insulin and C-peptide AUC when normalized for glucose AUC. 
      Statistically significant reductions in HBA1c were observed for all dose groups 
      except 0.3 mg. The most commonly reported adverse effects (AEs) were nausea (35 
      events), headache (20 events), vomiting (18 events) and diarrhoea (8 events). 
      CONCLUSIONS: LY showed improvement in fasting and postprandial glycaemic 
      parameters when administered once weekly in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The 
      pharmacokinetics and safety profiles also support further investigation of this 
      novel agent.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is an incretin hormone exhibiting several 
      pharmacological actions such as neuroprotection, increased cognitive function, 
      cardio-protection, decreased hypertension, suppression of acid secretion, 
      increase in lyposis, and protection from inflammation. The most potent actions 
      are glucose-dependent insulinotropic and glucagonostatic actions, stimulation of 
      β-cell proliferation, enhanced insulin secretion and reduced weight gain in 
      patients with type-2 diabetes pertaining to blood glucose control. Despite all 
      these actions, its short half-life (around 2∼min) and degradation by a dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 enzyme (DPP-4) limits the therapeutic utility of GLP1. In this 
      review, we have discussed DPP IV-resistant analogs of GLP-1 currently present in 
      clinical trials such as Exenatide, Liraglutide, Semaglutide, Efpeglenatide, 
      Exenatide ER, Ittca 650 (Intarcia), Dulaglutide, Albiglutide, and Lixisenatide. 
      Moreover, we have also discussed in detail the pharmacology, signaling 
      mechanisms, and pharmacokinetic properties (Cmax, Tmax, T(1/2,) Vd, and 
      Bioavailability) of DPP IV-resistant analogs of (GLP-1). Interestingly, GLP-1 
      agonist drugs have shown better potential to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) as compared to currently used drugs in clinics without causing the side 
      effects of hypoglycemia and weight gain.

TI  - Is there a justification for classifying GLP-1 receptor agonists as basal and 
      prandial?

AB  - Several GLP-1 receptor agonists are currently available for treatment of type 2 
      diabetic patients. Based on their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, these 
      drugs are classified as short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide and 
      lixisenatide) or long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide-LAR, liraglutide, 
      albiglutide, and dulaglutide). In clinical practice, they are also classified as 
      basal or prandial GLP-1 receptor agonists to differentiate between patients who 
      would benefit more from one or another based on characteristics such as previous 
      treatment and the predominance of fasting or postprandial hyperglycemia. In the 
      present article we examine available data on the pharmacokinetic characteristics 
      of the various GLP-1 agonists and compare their effects with respect to the main 
      parameters used to evaluate glycemic control. The article also analyzes whether 
      the differences between the different GLP-1 agonists justify their classification 
      as basal or prandial.

TI  - Efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues, and SGLT2 inhibitors as add-ons to 
      metformin monotherapy in T2DM patients: a model-based meta-analysis.
PG  - 393-402
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13807 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to quantitate the hypoglycaemic effects of 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1r) and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) as 
      add-on treatments to metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) using a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA). METHODS: A systematic 
      literature search of public databases was conducted to develop models that 
      describe the time courses of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG)- and haemoglobin 
      A1c (HbA1c)-lowering effects of three antidiabetic classes using NONMEM 7.3.0. 
      RESULTS: Seventy-six publications were eligible for this study, and 873 FPG and 
      1086 HbA1c values were collected. We developed a physiological indirect response 
      model that described the time courses of FPG and HbA1c and simulated reductions 
      in these values 90 days after the initiation of add-on treatments. FPG and HbA1c 
      reductions with once weekly exenatide, liraglutide and dulaglutide were greater 
      than those with other drugs. Mean changes from baseline FPG and HbA1c with these 
      drugs were as follows: exenatide (-22.5 and -16.6%), liraglutide (-22.1 and 
      -16.3%), and dulaglutide (-19.3 and -14.3%). The hypoglycaemic effects of DPP-4i 
      and SGLT2i were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Once weekly exenatide, liraglutide and 
      dulaglutide provided better hypoglycaemic effects among the antidiabetic drugs 
      analysed. Long-acting GLP-1r appears to be more useful for T2DM patients 
      inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Are all GLP-1 agonists equal in the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes?
PG  - R211-R234
LID - 10.1530/EJE-19-0566 [doi]
AB  - GLP-1, a peptide hormone secreted from the gut, stimulating insulin and 
      suppressing glucagon secretion was identified as a parent compound for novel 
      treatments of diabetes, but was degraded (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) and eliminated 
      (mainly by kidneys) too fast (half-life 1-2 min) to be useful as a therapeutic 
      agent. GLP-1 receptor agonist has been used to treat patients with type 2 
      diabetes since 2007, when exenatide (twice daily) was approved in 2007. Compounds 
      with longer duration of action (once daily, once weekly) and with increasingly 
      better efficacy with respect to glycaemic control and body weight reduction have 
      been developed, and in a recent ADA/EASD consensus statement, were recommended as 
      the first injectable diabetes therapy after failure of oral glucose-lowering 
      medications. Most GLP-1 receptor agonists (lixisenatide q.d., liraglutide q.d., 
      exenatide q.w., dulaglutide q.w., albiglutide q.w., semaglutide q.w., all for 
      s.c. injection, and the first oral preparation, oral semaglutide) have been 
      examined in cardiovascular outcomes studies. Beyond proving their safety in 
      vulnerable patients, most of whom had pre-existing heart disease, liraglutide, 
      semaglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide reduced the time to first major adverse 
      cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, cardiovascular 
      death). Liraglutide, in addition, reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
      It is the purpose of the present review to describe clinically important 
      differences, regarding pharmacokinetic behaviour, glucose-lowering potency, 
      effectiveness of reducing body weight and controlling other cardiovascular risk 
      factors, and of the influence of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment on 
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients either presenting with or without 
      pre-existing cardiovascular disease (atherosclerotic, ischemic or congestive 
      heart failure).

AB  - Tirzepatide (mounjaro(®)) is a derivative of the human glucose-dependent 
      insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) hormone with a position-20 being modified with 
      1,20- eicosanedioic acid via a chemical linker. It acts as a glucagon-like

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy has been implicated as a 
      possible risk factor for acute pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
      Dulaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist in development for treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes. The effects of dulaglutide were evaluated in male Zucker 
      diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats to examine whether dulaglutide may induce or modulate 
      pancreatitis. Rats were randomized to dose groups receiving twice-weekly 
      subcutaneously administered dulaglutide 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg/dose 
      (corresponding human plasma exposures following twice-weekly dosing are 3-, 8-, 
      and 30-fold, respectively) for 13 weeks or to vehicle control. Following 
      termination, serially trimmed sections of pancreases were stained with 
      hematoxylin and eosin or co-stained with an epithelial marker and a marker of 
      either proliferation or apoptosis. Efficacious reductions in glucose and 
      hemoglobin A1c occurred at all dulaglutide doses. Lipase activity was unaffected, 
      and there were modest increases in total and pancreatic amylase activities at all 
      doses without individual microscopic inflammatory correlates. Microscopic 
      dulaglutide-related pancreatic changes included increased interlobular ductal 
      epithelium without ductal cell proliferation (≥0.5 mg/kg), increased acinar 
      atrophy with/without inflammation (≥1.5 mg/kg), and increased incidence/severity 
      of neutrophilic acinar pancreatic inflammation (5.0 mg/kg). In summary, 
      dulaglutide treatment was associated with mild alterations in ductal epithelium 
      and modest exacerbation of spontaneous lesions of the exocrine pancreas typically 
      found in the ZDF rat model.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing at an astounding rate. Many of 
      the agents used to treat type 2 diabetes have undesirable adverse effects of 
      hypoglycemia and weight gain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists 
      represent a unique approach to the treatment of diabetes, with benefits extending 
      outside glucose control, including positive effects on weight, blood pressure, 
      cholesterol levels, and beta-cell function. They mimic the effects of the 
      incretin hormone GLP-1, which is released from the intestine in response to food 
      intake. Their effects include increasing insulin secretion, decreasing glucagon 
      release, increasing satiety, and slowing gastric emptying. There are currently 
      four approved GLP-1 receptor agonists in the United States: exenatide, 
      liraglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide. A fifth agent, lixisenatide, is 
      available in Europe. There are important pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and 
      clinical differences of each agent. The most common adverse effects seen with 
      GLP-1 therapy include nausea, vomiting, and injection-site reactions. Other 
      warnings and precautions include pancreatitis and thyroid cell carcinomas. GLP-1 
      receptor agonists are an innovative and effective option to improve blood glucose 
      control, with other potential benefits of preserving beta-cell function, weight 
      loss, and increasing insulin sensitivity. Once-weekly formulations may also 
      improve patient adherence. Overall, these are effective agents for patients with 
      type 2 diabetes, who are either uncontrolled on metformin or intolerant to 
      metformin.

TI  - A long-acting GDF15 analog causes robust, sustained weight loss and reduction of 
      food intake in an obese nonhuman primate model.
PG  - 1431-1444
LID - 10.1111/cts.13543 [doi]
AB  - Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15) is a circulating polypeptide linked to 
      cellular stress and metabolic adaptation. GDF15's half-life is ~3 h and activates 
      the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-like 
      (GFRAL) receptor expressed in the area postrema. To characterize sustained GFRAL 
      agonism on food intake (FI) and body weight (BW), we tested a half-life extended 
      analog of GDF15 (Compound H [CpdH]) suitable for reduced dosing frequency in 
      obese cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were chronically treated once weekly (q.w.) 
      with CpdH or long-acting GLP-1 analog dulaglutide. Mechanism-based longitudinal 
      exposure-response modeling characterized effects of CpdH and dulaglutide on FI 
      and BW. The novel model accounts for both acute, exposure-dependent effects 
      reducing FI and compensatory changes in energy expenditure (EE) and FI occurring 
      over time with weight loss. CpdH had linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics 
      (terminal half-life ~8 days) and treatment caused exposure-dependent reductions 
      in FI and BW. The 1.6 mg/kg CpdH reduced mean FI by 57.5% at 1 week and sustained 
      FI reductions of 31.5% from weeks 9-12, resulting in peak reduction in BW of 
      16 ± 5%. Dulaglutide had more modest effects on FI and peak BW loss was 
      3.8 ± 4.0%. Longitudinal modeling of both the FI and BW profiles suggested 
      reductions in BW observed with both CpdH and dulaglutide were fully explained by 
      exposure-dependent reductions in FI without increase in EE. Upon verification of 
      the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship established in monkeys and 
      humans for dulaglutide, we predicted that CpdH could reach double digit BW loss 
      in humans. In summary, a long-acting GDF15 analog led to sustained reductions in 
      FI in overweight monkeys and holds potential for effective clinical obesity 
      pharmacotherapy.

AB  - AIMS: To review the evolution and advancement of GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) 
      therapy, through the lens of randomised controlled trials, from differentiating 
      characteristics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and cardiovascular outcomes, to 
      evidence gaps and next steps. METHODS: Clinical review of published phase 3 or 
      later RCT data studying efficacy, safety, and outcomes of approved GLP-1 RA 
      therapies. RESULTS: Through a wealth of studies, including both 
      placebo-controlled and active-controlled studies, GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated 
      high glycemic efficacy and ability to facilitate weight loss, with minimal risk 
      of hypoglycemia, potential to restore beta cell function, and evidence for 
      improved cardiovascular outcomes in those at risk. CONCLUSIONS: Over a decade of 
      clinical studies have established the unique contributions of GLP-1 RAs in the 
      treatment of diabetes. Individual differences between the different GLP-1 RAs, in 
      delivery, pharmacokinetic and clinical effects, exist, allowing for tailored 
      approaches to clinical care. The strength of evidence generated through RCTs, 
      both short-term and long-term studies, will continue to evolve and inform our 
      current paradigms in diabetes care.

AB  - Glipizide is an oral glucose-lowering medication that is beneficial for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study compiles exhaustively all accessible 
      information on glipizide, from preclinical to clinical studies. Glipizide may be 
      used in concert with TRAIL to treat cancer cells; in vitro studies have shown 
      that it suppresses angiogenesis and vasculogenesis while shielding cells from 
      glycation-induced damage. Anticonvulsant effects and modifications in the 
      pharmacokinetics of other medications, such as Divalproex Sodium, were seen in 
      glipizide in vivo experiments. Propranolol amplifies glipizide's hypoglycemic 
      effect briefly in normal animals but consistently enhances it in diabetic ones. 
      In the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative poly(Q) illnesses, glipizide has 
      demonstrated to offer potential therapeutic advantages. It is ineffective in 
      preventing DENA-induced liver cancer and may cause DNA damage over time. The way 
      glipizide interacts with genetic variants may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. 
      Combining Syzygium cumini and ARBE to glipizide may enhance glycemic and lipid 
      control in type 2 diabetes. Individuals with coronary artery disease who take 
      glipizide or glyburide have an increased risk of death. The risk of muscular 
      responses and acute pancreatitis is minimal when glipizide and dulaglutide are 
      combined. In conclusion, glipizide has shown promising therapeutic efficacy 
      across a variety of disorders.

      Past, present, and future.
PG  - 254-67
LID - 10.4103/2230-8210.176351 [doi]
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapy improves glycaemic control through 
      multiple mechanisms, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and the additional benefit 
      of clinically relevant weight loss. Since Starling and Bayliss first proposed the 
      existence of intestinal secretions that stimulate the pancreas, tremendous 
      progress has been made in the area of incretins. As a number of GLP-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1 RAs) continue to become available, physicians will soon face the 
      challenge of selecting the right option customized to their patient's needs. The 
      following discussion, derived from an extensive literature search using the 
      PubMed database, applying the terms incretin, GLP-1, exenatide, liraglutide, 
      albiglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, and taspoglutide, provides a 
      comprehensive review of existing and upcoming molecules in the GLP-1 RA class in 
      terms of their structure, pharmacological profiles, efficacy, safety, and 
      convenience. Search Methodology: A literature search was conducted using the 
      PubMed database, applying the terms incretin, GLP-1, exenatide, liraglutide, 
      albiglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, and taspoglutide. Relevant 
      articles were those that discussed structural, pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic differences, classification, long-acting and short-acting GLP-1 
      RAs, phase 3 trials, and expert opinions. Additional targeted searches were 
      conducted on diabetes treatment guidelines and reviews on safety, as well as the 
      American Diabetes Association/European Society for Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) 
      statement on pancreatic safety.

TI  - GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes mellitus: recent developments and 
      emerging agents.
PG  - 1174-86
LID - 10.1002/phar.1507 [doi]
AB  - More than 26 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2D). Many treatment options exist, but achieving long-term glycemic control in 
      patients with T2D remains challenging. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1 RAs) offer a treatment option that improves glycemic control and 
      reduces weight, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. They have emerged as attractive 
      options for the treatment of T2D, and significant advances and developments 
      continue to be published regarding these agents. To identify relevant literature 
      on emerging issues related to GLP-1 RAs, a search of the MEDLINE database was 
      performed. Studies published in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
      GLP-1 RAs were analyzed. Because of their advantages and unique mechanism of 
      action, GLP-1 RAs are currently being studied in new clinical areas, including in 
      combination with basal insulin, as adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes, and for 
      weight loss. In addition, there are several emerging agents in development. 
      Lixisenatide is a once-daily GLP-1 RA that targets postprandial glucose and may 
      be most useful when added to basal insulin as an alternative to rapid-acting 
      insulin. Albiglutide and dulaglutide are once-weekly GLP-1 RAs that may offer 
      more convenient dosing. The most common adverse effects of all GLP-1 RA agents 
      are gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), but the rates of 
      occurrence vary among agents. Due to the differences in pharmacokinetics, 
      efficacy, rates of adverse effects, and administration requirements within the 
      GLP-1 RA class, each agent should be evaluated independently. The future of GLP-1 
      RAs offers broader treatment options for T2D as well as potential in other 
      treatment areas.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic similarity study comparing the biosimilar candidate, LY05008, 
      with its reference product dulaglutide in healthy Chinese male subjects.
PG  - 727-735
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2023.2189009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has 
      been approved for improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of 
      cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. This study compared the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      profiles, safety, and immunogenicity of LY05008, a biosimilar candidate, to a 
      licensed product dulaglutide in healthy Chinese male subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: In this double-blind, open-label, parallel-group study, healthy 
      Chinese male subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either LY05008 or 
      dulaglutide subcutaneously. Primary study endpoints were PK parameters such as 
      the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity 
      (AUC(0 - ∞)), AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration 
      (AUC(0-t)), and maximum serum concentration (C(max)). Safety and immunogenicity 
      profiles were also included for data analysis. RESULTS: 82 subjects were 
      randomized to receive LY05008 (n = 41) or dulaglutide (n = 41). The 90% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of AUC(0 - ∞,) 
      AUC(0-t) and C(max) of LY05008 to dulaglutide were all within the bioequivalence 
      limits of 80%-125%. Other PK parameters, safety, and immunogenicity profiles were 
      comparable across the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated 
      PK similarity of LY05008, a dulaglutide biosimilar, to dulaglutide in healthy 
      Chinese male subjects, with comparable safety and immunogenicity data. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
      (Identifier No. ChiCTR2200066519).

TI  - Once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg restores insulin secretion in response to 
      intravenous glucose infusion.
PG  - 517-523
LID - 10.1111/dom.12847 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effects of dulaglutide 1.5 mg on first- and second-phase 
      insulin secretion in response to an intravenous (i.v.) glucose bolus challenge, 
      in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; primary objective) and in 
      healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover study, subjects received a single 
      subcutaneous injection of dulaglutide 1.5 mg or placebo on day 1 of each period. 
      On day 3, subjects underwent a 6-hour insulin infusion, followed by an i.v. 
      glucose bolus and a glucagon challenge during hyperglycaemia. Areas under the 
      concentration-time curve and maximum concentrations for first- (AUC(0)(-10) and 
      C(max0-10) ) and second-phase secretion (AUC(10)(-180) and C(max10-180) ) were 
      calculated for insulin and C-peptide. The glucose disappearance constant (K(g) ) 
      and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) were assessed. 
      RESULTS: In 20 subjects with T2DM, dulaglutide increased mean insulin AUC(0)(-10) 
      by 7.92-fold and C(max0-10) by 5.40-fold vs placebo, and mean AUC(10)(-180) and 
      C(max10-180) by 2.44- and 3.78- fold, respectively. In 10 healthy subjects, 
      dulaglutide increased the mean insulin AUC(0)(-10) by 3.09-fold and C(max0-10) by 
      2.96-fold vs placebo, and mean AUC(10)(-180) and C(max10-180) by 2.04- and 
      4.15-fold, respectively. The corresponding C-peptide values also increased. Mean 
      K(g) and HOMA-β were higher after dulaglutide compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In subjects with T2DM, a single dulaglutide 1.5-mg dose restored the first-phase 
      insulin secretion in response to an i.v. glucose bolus, increased the 
      second-phase insulin response and enhanced β-cell function.

TI  - A glycosylated Fc-fused glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exhibits 
      equivalent glucose lowering to but fewer gastrointestinal side effects than 
      dulaglutide.
PG  - 1455-1468

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a novel 
      glycosylated Fc-fused glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1-gFc) receptor agonist with 
      distinctive receptor binding affinity, designed to improve in vivo stability and 
      safety relative to the commercial GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide, and assess its 
      safety profile and pharmacokinetics in healthy humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      constructed GLP-1-gFc and determined its binding affinity and potency using in 
      vitro instrumental and cell-based analyses followed by in vivo comparison of the 
      glucose-lowering and gastrointestinal side effects between GLP-1-gFc and 
      dulaglutide. A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to confirm the efficacy and 
      safety profile of GLP-1-gFc. RESULTS: GLP-1-gFc showed 10-fold less binding 
      affinity and 4-fold less potency than dulaglutide in in vitro. A potency-adjusted 
      dose delayed HbA1c increase comparable with that of dulaglutide (Change for 
      6 weeks: 2.4 mg/kg GLP-1-gFc, 4.34 ± 0.40 vs. 0.6 mg/kg dulaglutide, 4.26 ± 0.22; 
      n.s.). However, the equivalent efficacy dose and higher dose did not induce 
      malaise-related responses (blueberry bar consumption, g/mouse: 2.4 mg/kg 
      GLP-1-gFc, 0.15% ± 0.03% vs. 0.6 mg/kg dulaglutide, 0.04% ± 0.01%; P < .01) or QT 
      interval changes (mean at 14-20 hours, mSc: 0.28 mg/kg GLP-1-gFc, 0.0-8.0 vs. 
      0.07 mg/kg dulaglutide, 8.0-27.7; n.s.), observed as safety variables in rats and 
      monkeys, compared with those of dulaglutide. Glucose reductions in an oral 
      glucose tolerance test were significant at day 3 postdose without severe 
      gastrointestinal adverse events and pulse rate changes in healthy subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GLP-1-gFc could be used as a novel GLP-1 
      receptor agonist with better safety than dulaglutide to maximize therapeutic 
      benefits in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - No Dose Adjustment is Recommended for Digoxin, Warfarin, Atorvastatin or a 
      Combination Oral Contraceptive When Coadministered with Dulaglutide.
PG  - 1415-1427
LID - 10.1007/s40262-017-0531-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to delay gastric emptying (GE). 
      The potential effect of the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      four orally administered drugs and on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of warfarin 
      was investigated. METHODS: In four separate clinical pharmacology studies, 
      digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin and Ortho-Cyclen(®) were orally administered to 
      healthy subjects with and without a subcutaneous dose of dulaglutide 1.5 mg. The 
      effect of dulaglutide coadministration was assessed based on the PK parameters of 
      key analytes. For warfarin PD, the effect of dulaglutide on the international 
      normalized ratio (INR) was evaluated. RESULTS: Areas under the concentration-time 
      curves (AUCs) with and without dulaglutide were similar for all analytes except 
      atorvastatin, where it was reduced by 21%. Maximum concentrations (C (max)) were 
      generally lower following coadministration with dulaglutide, with statistically 
      significant reductions (90% confidence intervals of geometric least squares means 
      ratios outside 0.80-1.25) for all analytes except R-warfarin. For all analytes, 
      there was a general trend for the time to C (max) (t (max)) to increase following 
      coadministration with dulaglutide. For warfarin, dulaglutide coadministration had 
      no statistically significant effect on the maximum INR (INR(max)); however, a 2% 
      increase in area under the INR curve (AUC(INR)) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dulaglutide did not affect the absorption of the tested medications to a 
      clinically relevant degree. Based on the PK and PD evaluations, no dose 
      adjustments for digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin and Ortho-Cyclen(®) are 
      recommended when coadministered with dulaglutide. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBERS: NCT01458210, NCT01436201, NCT01432938, and NCT01250834.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Atorvastatin Incorporating 
      Delayed Gastric Emptying and Acid-to-Lactone Conversion.
PG  - 664-675
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12447 [doi]
AB  - The drug-drug interaction profile of atorvastatin confirms that disposition is 
      determined by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and organic anion transporting 
      polypeptides (OATPs). Drugs that affect gastric emptying, including dulaglutide, 
      also affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics (PK). Atorvastatin is a carboxylic acid 
      that exists in equilibrium with a lactone form in vivo. The purpose of this work 
      was to assess gastric acid-mediated lactone equilibration of atorvastatin and 
      incorporate this into a physiologically-based PK (PBPK) model to describe 
      atorvastatin acid, lactone, and their major metabolites. In vitro acid-to-lactone 
      conversion was assessed in simulated gastric fluid and included in the model. The 
      PBPK model was verified with in vivo data including CYP3A4 and OATP inhibition 
      studies. Altering the gastric acid-lactone equilibrium reproduced the change in 
      atorvastatin PK observed with dulaglutide. The model emphasizes the need to 
      include gastric acid-lactone conversion and all major atorvastatin-related 
      species for the prediction of atorvastatin PK.

AB  - AIMS: Glucagon like-peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based drugs have been proposed as mono- or 
      combined therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus we characterized a novel 
      antibody fusion protein engineered by linking the human GLP-1 derivative to a 
      humanized GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antibody via a peptide linker. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Glutazumab was characterized by receptor binding and reporter activation 
      assays, and its specificity was investigated with the aid of the cognate receptor 
      antagonist exendin (9-39) and antibody Ab1. Pharmacokinetics was evaluated in 
      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and pharmacodynamics was 
      assessed in normal ICR and spontaneous type 2 diabetic KKAy mice. Hypoglycemic 
      effects were evaluated after acute administration and glucose metabolism and 
      β-cell function were assessed with repeated administrations. Dulaglutide was a 
      positive control in all experiments. RESULTS: Glutazumab significantly bound and 
      activated GLP-1R, but the receptor antagonist exendin (9-39) did not inhibit the 
      activation except when combined with Ab1. Single injection of glutazumab reduced 
      the blood glucose in ICR mice and KKAy mice, and the half-lives in SD rats and 
      cynomolgus monkeys were 18 h and 33.6 h. Repeated injections of glutazumab 
      controlled glycemic fluctuations and improved β-cell function in KKAy mice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As a novel GLP-1R agonist, glutazumab may be a potential treatment 
      for T2DM.

TI  - Engineering and characterization of the long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 
      analogue LY2189265, an Fc fusion protein.
PG  - 287-96
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.1080 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are novel agents 
      for type 2 diabetes treatment, offering glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects, 
      reduced glucagonemia and a neutral bodyweight or weight-reducing profile. 
      However, a short half-life (minutes), secondary to rapid inactivation by 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and excretion, limits the therapeutic potential 
      of the native GLP-1 hormone. Recently, the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide 
      injected subcutaneously twice daily established a novel therapy class. Developing 
      long-acting and efficacious GLP-1 analogues represents a pivotal research goal. 
      We developed a GLP-1 immunoglobulin G (IgG4) Fc fusion protein (LY2189265) with 
      extended pharmacokinetics and activity. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo activity of 
      LY2189265 was characterized in rodent and primate cell systems and animal models. 
      RESULTS: LY2189265 retained full receptor activity in vitro and elicited 
      insulinotropic activity in islets similar to native peptide. Half-life in rats 
      and cynomolgus monkeys was 1.5-2 days, and serum immunoreactivity representing 
      active compound persisted > 6 days. In rats, LY2189265 enhanced insulin responses 
      during graded glucose infusion 24 h after one dose. LY2189265 increased glucose 
      tolerance in diabetic mice after one dose and lowered weight and delayed 
      hyperglycaemia when administered twice weekly for 4 weeks. In monkeys, LY2189265 
      significantly increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion for up to a week 
      after one dose, retained efficacy when administered subchronically (once weekly 
      for 4 weeks) and was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: LY2189265 retains the effects 
      of GLP-1 with increased half-life and efficacy, supporting further evaluation as 
      a once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Impact on HbA1c and body weight of switching from other GLP-1 receptor agonists 
      to semaglutide: A model-based approach.
PG  - 43-51
LID - 10.1111/dom.13479 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue approved for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. The impact of switching treatment from another 
      GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to semaglutide was investigated by analyses of 
      exposure-response models. METHODS: HbA1c and body weight time-course models were 
      developed, using up to 30 weeks of observations from four trials in the 
      semaglutide phase 3 programme. Given the recommended dosing for each GLP-1RA, 
      pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated based on published population 
      pharmacokinetic models and exposure was adjusted by the relative potencies to 
      ensure that model predictions matched the effects observed in clinical trials. 
      After 26 weeks of simulated treatment with liraglutide, dulaglutide or exenatide 
      extended-release, simulated semaglutide treatment was initiated 1 day after the 
      last once-daily dose of liraglutide and 1 week after the last once-weekly doses 
      of dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release. RESULTS: The potency-adjusted total 
      effective GLP-1RA concentration increased after switching from another GLP-1RA to 
      semaglutide and was associated with reductions ranging from ~0.3% to ~0.8%-points 
      for HbA1c and from ~2% to ~4% for body weight with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Temporary 
      slight deteriorations in HbA1c were observed after switching to semaglutide 
      0.25 mg from liraglutide 1.2/1.8 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Exposure-response modelling suggests that switching to semaglutide from 
      liraglutide, dulaglutide or exenatide extended-release results in further 
      reductions in HbA1c and body weight. Initial slight deterioration in outcome 
      values when switching to semaglutide 0.25 mg could be avoided by initiating 
      semaglutide treatment at a higher dose.

TI  - Simultaneous Catabolite Identification and Quantitation of Large Therapeutic 
      Protein at the Intact Level by Immunoaffinity Capture Liquid 
      Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 6065-6075
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00674 [doi]
AB  - As therapeutic recombinant fusion proteins become more widely applicable for the 
      treatment of various types of diseases, there is an increased demand for 
      universal methods such as liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) for 
      the determination of their pharmacokinetic properties, particularly their 
      catabolism. The most common approach of analyzing proteins by LC-MS is to digest 
      them into peptides, which can serve as surrogates of the protein. Alternatively, 
      we have developed a novel high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) based approach 
      for analyzing large-molecule proteins at the intact level in biological samples 
      without digestion. We established an immunoaffinity capture LC-HRMS method to 
      quantify the intact parent molecule while simultaneously identifying catabolites 
      for recombinant fusion proteins. We describe this method using dulaglutide, a 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-Fc fusion protein. Two proteolytic sites within 
      the GLP1 peptide sequence of dulaglutide were identified using this novel LC-HRMS 
      analysis in vivo in mice. These proteolytic sites were identified with the intact 
      molecule being quantified simultaneously. Together with the trypsin digestion 
      based LC-MS/MS analysis using surrogate peptides from different domains of the 
      analyte, an insightful understanding of the pharmacokinetics and in vivo 
      biotransformation of dulaglutide was obtained. Thus, this method enables 
      simultaneous acquisition of both intact drug concentration and important 
      catabolite information for this recombinant fusion protein, providing valuable 
      insight into the integrity of the molecule and its catabolism in vivo. This is 
      critical for designing and screening novel protein therapeutics and for 
      understanding their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. With continuing 
      advancement of LC-HRMS and software, this method can be very beneficial in drug 
      discovery and development.

TI  - Choice of first injectable therapy in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1343-1346
AB  - A variety of injectable therapies are now available for use in patients of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, when metformin alone proves inadequate. These injectable 
      therapies include basal insulins, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP1RA), co-formulations of basal insulin with GLP1RA, and premixed or 
      co-formulated dual action insulins. This article helps choose appropriate first 
      injectable therapy in a rational manner, and achieve glycaemic control in an 
      efficient way. The discussion utilizes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties of various injectable drugs to match them with various clinical 
      situations. It highlights a gluco-phenotypic approach, utilizing readily 
      available anthropometric measurements, glycaemic patterns, and other bio 
      psychosocial parameters, to create a simple model which facilitates correct 
      choice of first injectable therapy in type 2 diabetes.

      treated with insulin (hepatocytes only), glucagon (hepatocytes and cynomolgus 
      monkeys), the GLP1R agonist, dulaglutide, or a variety of dual agonists with 
      varying GCGR potencies. RESULTS: A long-acting dual agonist, Compound 2, 
      significantly decreased amino acids in both wild-type and GLP1R knockout mice in 
      the absence of changes in food intake, body weight, glucose or insulin, and 
      increased expression of hepatic amino acid transporters. Dulaglutide, or a 
      variant of Compound 2 lacking GCGR agonism, had no effect on amino acids. A third 
      variant with ~31-fold less GCGR potency than Compound 2 significantly decreased 
      amino acids, albeit to a significantly lesser extent than Compound 2. Dulaglutide 
      (with saline infusion) had no effect on amino acids, but an infusion of glucagon 
      dose-dependently decreased amino acids on the background of GLP1R engagement 
      (dulaglutide) in cynomolgus monkeys, as did Compound 2. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results show that amino acids are sensitive and translatable GCGR-specific 
      biomarkers.

TI  - DR10601, a novel recombinant long-acting dual glucagon-like peptide-1 and 
      glucagon receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 653-662
LID - 10.1007/s40618-019-01153-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon (GCG) belong to the 
      incretin family. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of DR10601, a fully recombinant hybrid peptide with dual 
      GLP-1/GCG receptor agonistic activity. METHODS: The agonistic ability of DR10601 
      was indirectly assessed by inducing cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary 
      cells transfected with GLP-1R or GCGR in vitro. Following s.c. administration, 
      the plasma pharmacokinetics of DR10601 were analysed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. 
      The antiobesity effects and improved glycaemic control of DR10601 in vivo were 
      evaluated by administering DR10601 to high-fat DIO mice and ICR mice as a single 
      dose or repeated s.c. doses once every 4 days for 24 days. RESULTS: DR10601 
      exhibits dual agonistic activity on GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. The plasma 
      half-life of DR10601 in Sprague-Dawley rats following s.c. administration was 
      51.9 ± 12.2 h. In an IPGTT, a single s.c. dose of DR10601 (30 nmol/kg) produced 
      similar glycaemic control effects and a longer duration of action compared to 
      dulaglutide (10 nmol/kg). Compared with that achieved with liraglutide 
      (40 nmol/kg) s.c. administered daily, DR10601 administered s.c. once every 4 days 
      at 90 nmol/kg exerted a nearly equivalent effect on food intake and significantly 
      reduced the body weights of high-fat DIO mice at 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated 
      administration of DR1060 provides potent and sustained glycemic control and body 
      weight loss effect in high-fat DIO mice. DR10601 is a promising long-acting agent 
      deserving further investigation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

TI  - LY2189265, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, showed a 
      dose-dependent effect on insulin secretion in healthy subjects.
PG  - 434-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01365.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and 
      potential immunogenicity of single, escalating subcutaneous injections of a 
      once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in healthy subjects. METHODS: This 
      phase 1, three-period, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
      investigated single, escalating subcutaneous doses of LY2189265 (LY) ranging from 
      0.1 to 12 mg; approximately six subjects were randomized to each dose. Parameters 
      of safety, including adverse events, were assessed. The pharmacokinetic profile 
      was assessed over 14 days. Pharmacodynamic parameters (glucose and insulin 
      concentrations) were measured following a step-glucose infusion (day 3) and as 
      part of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (day 5). RESULTS: LY was generally 
      well tolerated with some increase in gastrointestinal symptoms with escalating 
      doses. There were small dose-dependent increases in pulse rate with doses ≥1.0 mg 
      and diastolic blood pressure with doses ≥3.0 mg. The half-life of LY was 
      approximately 90 h, with C(max) occurring between 24 and 48 h in most subjects. 
      Evidence of increase in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppression of 
      serum glucose excursions were observed during an OGTT at all doses compared to 
      placebo; no episodes of hypoglycaemia occurred. No subjects developed antibodies 
      to LY2189265. CONCLUSIONS: LY showed an acceptable safety profile and exhibited 
      the expected glucagon-like peptide-1 pharmacological effects on glucose 
      suppression and insulin secretion with a half-life that supports once-weekly 
      dosing.

TI  - Dulaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analog fused with an Fc antibody fragment for 
      the potential treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 790-7
AB  - Dulaglutide (LY-2189265) is a novel, long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
      analog being developed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). Dulaglutide consists of GLP-1(7-37) covalently linked to an Fc fragment 
      of human IgG4, thereby protecting the GLP-1 moiety from inactivation by 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4. In vitro and in vivo studies on T2DM models demonstrated 
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion stimulation. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      demonstrated a t1/2 in humans of up to 90 h, making dulaglutide an ideal 
      candidate for once-weekly dosing. Clinical trials suggest that dulaglutide 
      reduces plasma glucose, and has an insulinotropic effect increasing insulin and 
      C-peptide levels. Two phase II clinical trials demonstrated a dose-dependent 
      reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of up to 1.52% compared with placebo. 
      Side effects associated with dulaglutide administration were mainly 
      gastrointestinal. To date, there have been no reports on the formation of 
      antibodies against dulaglutide, but, clearly, long-term data will be needed to 
      asses this and other possible side effects. The results of several phase III 
      clinical trials are awaited for clarification of the expected effects on HbA1c 
      and body weight. If dulaglutide possesses similar efficacy to other GLP-1 
      analogs, the once-weekly treatment will most likely be welcomed by patients with 
      T2DM.

TI  - GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 peptide-antibody conjugate requires brain GIPR and GLP-1R for 
      additive weight loss in obese mice.
LID - 10.1038/s42255-025-01295-w [doi]
AB  - Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and glucagon-like 
      peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and 
      regulate food intake. Here, we demonstrate that a peptide-antibody conjugate that 
      blocks GIPR while simultaneously activating GLP-1R (GIPR-Ab/GLP-1) requires both 
      CNS GIPR and CNS GLP-1R for maximal weight loss in obese, primarily male, mice. 
      Moreover, dulaglutide produces greater weight loss in CNS GIPR knockout (KO) 
      mice, and the weight loss achieved with dulaglutide + GIPR-Ab is attenuated in 
      CNS GIPR KO mice. Wild-type mice treated with GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 and CNS GIPR KO mice 
      exhibit similar changes in gene expression related to tissue remodelling, lipid 
      metabolism and inflammation in white adipose tissue and liver. Moreover, 
      GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 is detected in circumventricular organs in the brain and activates 
      c-FOS in downstream neural substrates involved in appetite regulation. Hence, 
      both CNS GIPR and GLP-1R signalling are required for the full weight loss effect 
      of a GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 peptide-antibody conjugate.

TI  - The effects of LY2189265, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, in a 
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of overweight/obese patients 
      with type 2 diabetes: the EGO study.
PG  - 418-25
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01366.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of once-weekly LY2189265 (LY), a 
      novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) IgG4-Fc fusion protein, in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes failing oral antihyperglycaemic medications (OAMs). METHODS: 
      Placebo-controlled, double-blind study in 262 patients (mean age 57 ± 12 years; 
      BMI 33.9 ± 4.1 kg/m(2); and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (A1c) 8.24 ± 0.93%) 
      receiving two OAMs. Patients were randomized to once-weekly subcutaneous 
      injections of placebo or LY 0.5 mg for 4 weeks, then 1.0 mg for 12 weeks (LY 
      0.5/1.0); 1.0 mg for 16 weeks (LY 1.0/1.0); or 1.0 mg for 4 weeks, then 2.0 mg 
      for 12 weeks (LY 1.0/2.0). RESULTS: At week 16, A1c changes (least-squares mean ± 
      standard error) were -0.24 ± 0.12, -1.38 ± 0.12, -1.32 ± 0.12 and -1.59 ± 0.12%, 
      in the placebo, LY 0.5/1.0, LY 1.0/1.0 and LY 1.0/2.0 arms, respectively (all p < 
      0.001 vs. placebo). Both fasting (p < 0.001) and postprandial (p < 0.05) blood 
      glucose decreased significantly compared to placebo at all LY doses. Weight loss 
      was dose dependent and ranged from -1.34 ± 0.39 to -2.55 ± 0.40 kg at 16 weeks 
      (all p < 0.05 vs. placebo). At the highest LY dosage, the most common adverse 
      events were nausea (13.8%), diarrhoea (13.8%) and abdominal distension (13.8%). 
      Hypoglycaemia was uncommon overall (≤0.8 episodes/patient/30 days) but more 
      common with LY than placebo through the initial 4 weeks (p < 0.05). No 
      differences in cardiovascular events or blood pressure were shown between 
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: LY2189265, given to overweight/obese patients with type 
      2 diabetes for 16 weeks in combination with OAMs, was relatively well tolerated 
      and significantly reduced A1c, blood glucose and body weight.

TI  - dulaglutide (Trulicity°) weekly in type 2 diabetes: Cardiovascular reactions 
      should be better documented.
PG  - 236-237
AB  - In four trials including a total of more than 3000 patients, dulaglutide reduced 
      the HbA1c concentration as effectively as other GLP-1 analogues when added to 
      other hypoglycaemic drugs. The long elimination half-life of dulaglutide can make 
      management of adverse effects and drug interactions more difficult. More data are 
      needed on possible cardiac adverse effects.
