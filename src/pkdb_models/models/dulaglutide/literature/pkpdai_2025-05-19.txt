AB  - AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of LY2189265 (LY), a novel, long-acting glucagen-like peptide-1 
      analogue, administered once weekly to subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 
      This was a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, subject- and investigator-blind 
      study of LY in subjects (N = 43) with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with 
      diet and exercise alone or with a single oral antidiabetic medication. Subjects 
      taking metformin or thiazolidinediones continued on their therapy. Subjects 
      receiving sulfonylurea, acarbose, repaglinide or nateglinide were switched to 
      metformin prior to enrollment. Subjects received five once-weekly doses of 0.05, 
      0.3, 1, 3, 5 or 8 mg. Effects on glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations 
      were determined during fasting and following standard test meals. The 
      pharmacokinetics of LY and its effects on HBA1c, glucagon, body weight, gastric 
      emptying and safety parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Once-weekly administration 
      of LY significantly reduced (p < 0.01) fasting plasma glucose, 2-h post-test meal 
      postprandial glucose and area under the curve (AUC) of glucose after test meals 
      at doses ≥1 mg. These effects were seen after the first dose and were sustained 
      through the weekly dosing cycle. Most doses produced statistically significant 
      increases in insulin and C-peptide AUC when normalized for glucose AUC. 
      Statistically significant reductions in HBA1c were observed for all dose groups 
      except 0.3 mg. The most commonly reported adverse effects (AEs) were nausea (35 
      events), headache (20 events), vomiting (18 events) and diarrhoea (8 events). 
      CONCLUSIONS: LY showed improvement in fasting and postprandial glycaemic 
      parameters when administered once weekly in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The 
      pharmacokinetics and safety profiles also support further investigation of this 
      novel agent.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Dulaglutide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: 
      Analyses of Data from Clinical Trials.
PG  - 625-34
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0338-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonist administered as once-weekly subcutaneous injections for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The clinical pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide 
      were characterized in patients with T2D and healthy subjects. METHODS: The 
      pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide were assessed throughout clinical development, 
      including conventional pharmacokinetic analysis in clinical pharmacology studies 
      and population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from combined phase 2 and phase 3 
      studies in patients with T2D. The effects of potential covariates on dulaglutide 
      population pharmacokinetics were evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects models. 
      RESULTS: Dulaglutide gradually reached the maximum concentration in 48 h and had 
      a terminal elimination half-life of 5 days. Steady state was achieved between the 
      second and fourth doses. The accumulation ratio was 1.56 for the 1.5 mg dose. 
      Intra-individual variability estimates for the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve and the maximum concentration were both <17% 
      [coefficient of variation (CV)]. There was no difference in pharmacokinetics 
      between injection sites (arm, thigh or abdomen). Dulaglutide pharmacokinetics 
      were well described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
      elimination. The population clearance was estimated at 0.126 L/h 
      [inter-individual variability (CV) 33.8%]. Age, body weight, sex, race and 
      ethnicity did not influence dulaglutide pharmacokinetics to any clinically 
      relevant degree. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide support 
      once-weekly administration in patients with T2D. The pharmacokinetic findings 
      suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary on the basis of body weight, sex, 
      age, race or ethnicity or site of injection.

TI  - LY2189265, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, showed a 
      dose-dependent effect on insulin secretion in healthy subjects.
PG  - 434-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01365.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and 
      potential immunogenicity of single, escalating subcutaneous injections of a 
      once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in healthy subjects. METHODS: This 
      phase 1, three-period, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
      investigated single, escalating subcutaneous doses of LY2189265 (LY) ranging from 
      0.1 to 12 mg; approximately six subjects were randomized to each dose. Parameters 
      of safety, including adverse events, were assessed. The pharmacokinetic profile 
      was assessed over 14 days. Pharmacodynamic parameters (glucose and insulin 
      concentrations) were measured following a step-glucose infusion (day 3) and as 
      part of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (day 5). RESULTS: LY was generally 
      well tolerated with some increase in gastrointestinal symptoms with escalating 
      doses. There were small dose-dependent increases in pulse rate with doses ≥1.0 mg 
      and diastolic blood pressure with doses ≥3.0 mg. The half-life of LY was 
      approximately 90 h, with C(max) occurring between 24 and 48 h in most subjects. 
      Evidence of increase in glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppression of 
      serum glucose excursions were observed during an OGTT at all doses compared to 
      placebo; no episodes of hypoglycaemia occurred. No subjects developed antibodies 
      to LY2189265. CONCLUSIONS: LY showed an acceptable safety profile and exhibited 
      the expected glucagon-like peptide-1 pharmacological effects on glucose 
      suppression and insulin secretion with a half-life that supports once-weekly 
      dosing.

TI  - DR10601, a novel recombinant long-acting dual glucagon-like peptide-1 and 
      glucagon receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 653-662
LID - 10.1007/s40618-019-01153-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon (GCG) belong to the 
      incretin family. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of DR10601, a fully recombinant hybrid peptide with dual 
      GLP-1/GCG receptor agonistic activity. METHODS: The agonistic ability of DR10601 
      was indirectly assessed by inducing cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary 
      cells transfected with GLP-1R or GCGR in vitro. Following s.c. administration, 
      the plasma pharmacokinetics of DR10601 were analysed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. 
      The antiobesity effects and improved glycaemic control of DR10601 in vivo were 
      evaluated by administering DR10601 to high-fat DIO mice and ICR mice as a single 
      dose or repeated s.c. doses once every 4 days for 24 days. RESULTS: DR10601 
      exhibits dual agonistic activity on GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. The plasma 
      half-life of DR10601 in Sprague-Dawley rats following s.c. administration was 
      51.9 ± 12.2 h. In an IPGTT, a single s.c. dose of DR10601 (30 nmol/kg) produced 
      similar glycaemic control effects and a longer duration of action compared to 
      dulaglutide (10 nmol/kg). Compared with that achieved with liraglutide 
      (40 nmol/kg) s.c. administered daily, DR10601 administered s.c. once every 4 days 
      at 90 nmol/kg exerted a nearly equivalent effect on food intake and significantly 
      reduced the body weights of high-fat DIO mice at 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated 
      administration of DR1060 provides potent and sustained glycemic control and body 
      weight loss effect in high-fat DIO mice. DR10601 is a promising long-acting agent 
      deserving further investigation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

      glycosylated Fc-fused glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1-gFc) receptor agonist with 
      distinctive receptor binding affinity, designed to improve in vivo stability and 
      safety relative to the commercial GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide, and assess its 
      safety profile and pharmacokinetics in healthy humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      constructed GLP-1-gFc and determined its binding affinity and potency using in 
      vitro instrumental and cell-based analyses followed by in vivo comparison of the 
      glucose-lowering and gastrointestinal side effects between GLP-1-gFc and 
      dulaglutide. A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to confirm the efficacy and 
      safety profile of GLP-1-gFc. RESULTS: GLP-1-gFc showed 10-fold less binding 
      affinity and 4-fold less potency than dulaglutide in in vitro. A potency-adjusted 
      dose delayed HbA1c increase comparable with that of dulaglutide (Change for 
      6 weeks: 2.4 mg/kg GLP-1-gFc, 4.34 ± 0.40 vs. 0.6 mg/kg dulaglutide, 4.26 ± 0.22; 
      n.s.). However, the equivalent efficacy dose and higher dose did not induce 
      malaise-related responses (blueberry bar consumption, g/mouse: 2.4 mg/kg 
      GLP-1-gFc, 0.15% ± 0.03% vs. 0.6 mg/kg dulaglutide, 0.04% ± 0.01%; P < .01) or QT 
      interval changes (mean at 14-20 hours, mSc: 0.28 mg/kg GLP-1-gFc, 0.0-8.0 vs. 
      0.07 mg/kg dulaglutide, 8.0-27.7; n.s.), observed as safety variables in rats and 
      monkeys, compared with those of dulaglutide. Glucose reductions in an oral 
      glucose tolerance test were significant at day 3 postdose without severe 
      gastrointestinal adverse events and pulse rate changes in healthy subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GLP-1-gFc could be used as a novel GLP-1 
      receptor agonist with better safety than dulaglutide to maximize therapeutic 
      benefits in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Atorvastatin Incorporating 
      Delayed Gastric Emptying and Acid-to-Lactone Conversion.
PG  - 664-675
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12447 [doi]
AB  - The drug-drug interaction profile of atorvastatin confirms that disposition is 
      determined by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and organic anion transporting 
      polypeptides (OATPs). Drugs that affect gastric emptying, including dulaglutide, 
      also affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics (PK). Atorvastatin is a carboxylic acid 
      that exists in equilibrium with a lactone form in vivo. The purpose of this work 
      was to assess gastric acid-mediated lactone equilibration of atorvastatin and 
      incorporate this into a physiologically-based PK (PBPK) model to describe 
      atorvastatin acid, lactone, and their major metabolites. In vitro acid-to-lactone 
      conversion was assessed in simulated gastric fluid and included in the model. The 
      PBPK model was verified with in vivo data including CYP3A4 and OATP inhibition 
      studies. Altering the gastric acid-lactone equilibrium reproduced the change in 
      atorvastatin PK observed with dulaglutide. The model emphasizes the need to 
      include gastric acid-lactone conversion and all major atorvastatin-related 
      species for the prediction of atorvastatin PK.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to delay gastric emptying (GE). 
      The potential effect of the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      four orally administered drugs and on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of warfarin 
      was investigated. METHODS: In four separate clinical pharmacology studies, 
      digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin and Ortho-Cyclen(®) were orally administered to 
      healthy subjects with and without a subcutaneous dose of dulaglutide 1.5 mg. The 
      effect of dulaglutide coadministration was assessed based on the PK parameters of 
      key analytes. For warfarin PD, the effect of dulaglutide on the international 
      normalized ratio (INR) was evaluated. RESULTS: Areas under the concentration-time 
      curves (AUCs) with and without dulaglutide were similar for all analytes except 
      atorvastatin, where it was reduced by 21%. Maximum concentrations (C (max)) were 
      generally lower following coadministration with dulaglutide, with statistically 
      significant reductions (90% confidence intervals of geometric least squares means 
      ratios outside 0.80-1.25) for all analytes except R-warfarin. For all analytes, 
      there was a general trend for the time to C (max) (t (max)) to increase following 
      coadministration with dulaglutide. For warfarin, dulaglutide coadministration had 
      no statistically significant effect on the maximum INR (INR(max)); however, a 2% 
      increase in area under the INR curve (AUC(INR)) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dulaglutide did not affect the absorption of the tested medications to a 
      clinically relevant degree. Based on the PK and PD evaluations, no dose 
      adjustments for digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin and Ortho-Cyclen(®) are 
      recommended when coadministered with dulaglutide. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Dulaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analog fused with an Fc antibody fragment for 
      the potential treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 790-7
AB  - Dulaglutide (LY-2189265) is a novel, long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
      analog being developed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). Dulaglutide consists of GLP-1(7-37) covalently linked to an Fc fragment 
      of human IgG4, thereby protecting the GLP-1 moiety from inactivation by 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4. In vitro and in vivo studies on T2DM models demonstrated 
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion stimulation. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      demonstrated a t1/2 in humans of up to 90 h, making dulaglutide an ideal 
      candidate for once-weekly dosing. Clinical trials suggest that dulaglutide 
      reduces plasma glucose, and has an insulinotropic effect increasing insulin and 
      C-peptide levels. Two phase II clinical trials demonstrated a dose-dependent 
      reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of up to 1.52% compared with placebo. 
      Side effects associated with dulaglutide administration were mainly 
      gastrointestinal. To date, there have been no reports on the formation of 
      antibodies against dulaglutide, but, clearly, long-term data will be needed to 
      asses this and other possible side effects. The results of several phase III 
      clinical trials are awaited for clarification of the expected effects on HbA1c 
      and body weight. If dulaglutide possesses similar efficacy to other GLP-1 
      analogs, the once-weekly treatment will most likely be welcomed by patients with 
      T2DM.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Dulaglutide After Single or 
      Multiple Doses in Chinese Healthy Subjects and Patients with T2DM: A Randomized, 
      Placebo-Controlled, Phase I Study.
PG  - 488-503
LID - 10.1007/s12325-021-01921-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and 
      safety of a single dulaglutide dose in Chinese healthy subjects and of multiple 
      dulaglutide doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: This two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 16 
      healthy subjects randomized to receive a single dose of placebo and two of three 
      dulaglutide doses (0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, or 1.5 mg) in three treatment periods, and 42 
      patients with T2DM randomized to receive placebo or one of the three dulaglutide 
      doses once weekly for 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetics and safety parameters were 
      assessed in all participants, and pharmacodynamics effects were investigated in 
      patients with T2DM. RESULTS: Following a single-dose administration of 0.5 mg, 
      0.75 mg, or 1.5 mg dulaglutide in healthy subjects, geometric mean maximum 
      concentrations (C(max)) were 29.4, 44.2, and 81.5 ng/mL, respectively. Following 
      weekly administration in patients with T2DM for 4 weeks, C(max) were 26.3, 41.4, 
      and 70.2 ng/mL, respectively, with accumulation ratios of 1.33-1.39. Geometric 
      mean for half-life of 4-5 days and median time to C(max) (t(max)) of 
      approximately 48 h were observed in both study populations. Dose-proportional 
      increases in drug exposure were observed after both single and multiple dosing. 
      Significant reductions in baseline-corrected fasting glucose and hemoglobin 
      A1c (HbA1c) were observed in patients with T2DM who received dulaglutide 0.75 mg 
      and 1.5 mg. Dulaglutide was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events 
      being gastrointestinal disorders of mild severity. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles of dulaglutide demonstrated in the present 
      study support a once-weekly dosing regimen in Chinese patients with T2DM. TRIAL

TI  - Brain uptake pharmacokinetics of albiglutide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, and 
      DA5-CH in the search for new treatments of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
PG  - 2292461
LID - 10.1080/21688370.2023.2292461 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of peptide incretin receptor agonists (IRAs) show promise as 
      therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Transport 
      across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one way for IRAs to act directly within 
      the brain. To determine which IRAs are high priority candidates for treating 
      these disorders, we have studied their brain uptake pharmacokinetics. METHODS: We 
      quantitatively measure the ability of four IRAs to cross the BBB. We injected 
      adult male CD-1 mice intravenously with (125)I- or (14)C-labeled albiglutide, 
      dulaglutide, DA5-CH, or tirzepatide and used multiple-time regression analyses to 
      measure brain kinetics up to 1 hour. For those IRAs failing to enter the brain 
      1 h after intravenous injection, we also investigated their ability to enter over 
      a longer time frame (i.e., 6 h). RESULTS: Albiglutide and dulaglutide had the 
      fastest brain uptake rates within 1 hour. DA5-CH appears to enter the brain 
      rapidly, reaching equilibrium quickly. Tirzepatide does not appear to cross the 
      BBB within 1 h after iv injection but like albumin, did so slowly over 6 h, 
      presumably via the extracellular pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We find that IRAs can 
      cross the BBB by two separate processes; one that is fast and one that is slow. 
      Three of the four IRAs investigated here have fast rates of transport and should 
      be taken into consideration for testing as AD and PD therapeutics as they would 
      have the ability to act quickly and directly on the brain as a whole.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs), safety, and 
      immunogenicity of the biosimilar HEC14028 compared to reference Trulicity® 
      (dulaglutide) in healthy male Chinese subjects. This study was a single-center, 
      randomized, open, single-dose, parallel-controlled comparative Phase I clinical 
      trial, including a screening period of up to 14 days, a 17-day observation period 
      after administration, and a 7-day safety follow-up period. A total of 68 healthy 
      male subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to the test group (HEC14028) and the 
      reference group (dulaglutide) (single 0.75 mg abdominal subcutaneous dose). The 
      primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of HEC14028 
      and compare the pharmacokinetic similarities between HEC14028 and dulaglutide. 
      The primary PK endpoints were maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area 
      under the blood concentration-time curve from zero time to the estimated infinite 
      time (AUC(0-∞)). The study results showed that HEC14028 and dulaglutide were 
      pharmacokinetically equivalent: 90% confidence interval (CI) of C(max) and 
      AUC(0-∞) geometric mean ratios were 102.9%-122.0% and 97.1%-116.9%, respectively, 
      which were both within the range of 80.00%-125.00%. No grade 3 or above treatment 
      emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs leading to 
      withdrawal from the trial, or TEAEs leading to death were reported in this study. 
      Both HEC14028 and dulaglutide showed good and similar safety profiles, and no 
      incremental immunogenicity was observed in subjects receiving HEC14028 and 
      dulaglutide.
